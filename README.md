# Robinhood Hackathon

## About Cryptohood

During the BrainStation Web Development bootcamp, we participated in an industry hackathon with Robinhood, a stock and crypto trading platformed based in the United States.

We were a cross-functional team made up of 4 UX Designers, 2 Web Developers and a Digital Marketer. We were tasked with creating a solution for Robinhood that would educate new investors interested in the crypto space and encourage them to invest on Robinhood's platform.

Users watch a video educating them about different crypto terms or technologies and the user answers questions about the video they just watched in order to receive credits that go towards investing into different tokens on Robinhood's platform.
